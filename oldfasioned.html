        <h1>Old Fashioned</h1>
        <p>The old fashioned is a favorite of mine. The bourbon will warm you up in the winter and the citrus will be a refreshing treat in the heat of summer. You can 
            enjoy this any time of the year and it only takes 4 ingredients (if you don't count the water).
        </p>
        <p>For this recipe we will need:
            <ul>
                <li>Bourbon is best but you can really use any whiskey you want. I use Buffalo Trace when available</li>
                <li>Sugar Cube(s)</li>
                <li>Orange</li>
                <li>Aromatic bitters</li>
                <li>water, both liquid and frozen</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>place a sugar cube in the bottom of your best tumbler</li>
                <li>add 2-3 dashes of bitters right on the cube and let cube dissolve</li>
                <li>Add 1 Tbsp water at room temperature</li>
                <li>stir until sugar granules are no longer visible, or you get tired of stirring</li>
                <li>peel a section of clean orange peel and twist to express the oil</li>
                <li>rub the oil on the rim of the glass and carefully place the orange peel on the side of the glass *make it a fancy twist for fun</li>
                <li>Place large ice cube, or two smaller cubes, or a small handful of little ice spheres, cubes or chrushed up bits in the glass</li>
                <li>Pour 2oz. bourbon over cube and give a stir</li>
                <li>While not required you can garnish with a luxardo cherry</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
